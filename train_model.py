Custom spaCy NER Model Training Script
=======================================
This script trains a custom Named Entity Recognition model to extract:
- SKILL: Technical skills (e.g., Python, React, Machine Learning)
- DEGREE: Educational qualifications (e.g., B.Tech, Bachelor of Science)
- JOB_TITLE: Professional roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst)

Run this script ONCE before launching the Streamlit app to generate the custom model.
